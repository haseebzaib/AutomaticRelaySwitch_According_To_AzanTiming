# @file rtcmcp7940.yaml
# @brief Device tree binding for Microchip MCP7940 I2C-based RTC.
#
# This binding file defines the configuration for the Microchip MCP7940
# real-time clock (RTC) connected via I2C. It specifies the compatible
# string and includes references to standard I2C device bindings.
#
# @compatible zephyr,rtcmcp7940
# @include i2c-device.yaml
#
# @details
# The MCP7940 RTC binding allows for configuration of its interrupt GPIO pin
# for alarm notifications. The binding leverages the Zephyr I2C framework to
# communicate with the RTC over the I2C bus.
#
# Example Usage:
# ```dts
# rtcmcp7940@6F {
#     compatible = "zephyr,rtcmcp7940";
#     reg = <0x6F>;
#     label = "RTC";
#     int-gpios = <&gpio0 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
# };
# ```
#
# @note Ensure that the I2C bus is enabled in the device tree and the
#       MCP7940 is connected with the appropriate interrupt GPIO configured.
